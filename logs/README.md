# Logs Directory

This directory stores application logs generated during runtime.

Two types of log files are created:
1. Automatic logs with timestamp: `scraper_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
2. Manually saved logs: `manual_save_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

Logs contain information about:
- API requests and responses
- Scraping progress
- Errors and warnings
- User actions
